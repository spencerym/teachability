            <h2>Common Challenges</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>Organization</h3>
                <p>Students with ADHD may have a hard time managing all the work they have and scheduling. There can be lots of deadlines on similar dates as well as a large workload from different classes that can overwhelm students. It’s possible that they also forget where they placed their belongings, making it even more stressful during school or at home.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Maintaining Focus</h3>
                <p>For students with the hyperactive type of ADHD, it is especially difficult to focus on the task at hand because they can easily be distracted by external things. Oftentimes lectures in school can be too long, which not only is difficult for people with ADHD to pay attention to, but can also overwhelm them. A common problem people with ADHD have is procrastination, where they cannot focus for long stretches of time, especially on assignments they do not have interest in.</p>

                <h3>Executive Dysfunction</h3>
                <p>Perhaps one of the most challenging things about having ADHD is not fully having control of one’s own thoughts and actions. This can result in impulsivity, which affects the student’s ability to do work, focus, and keep themselves organized.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Masking</h3>
                <p>How students attempt to mask their conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppressing stimming behaviors in class</li>
                    <li>Becoming a perfectionist</li>
                    <li>Staying quiet and being overly careful of what they say</li>
                    <li>Breaking down when in a safe environment due to masking</li>
                    <li>Being irritable in class</li>
                    <li>Overworking until exhaustion</li>
                </ul>
