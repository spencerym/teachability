            <h2>Understanding ADHD</h2>
            <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is commonly diagnosed in children but can also affect adults. There are two main types of ADHD:</p>
            <h3>Inattentive Type</h3>
            <p>People with Inattentive ADHD sometimes do not have the hyperactivity associated with ADHD. Instead, they are very prone to distractions, have a hard time finishing tasks, have trouble paying attention to details, and can easily forget chores. This is the most common type of ADHD with over 90% of ADHD adults with this condition. It is very common for people with ADHD to have more than one type. </p>
            <h3>Hyperactive-Impulsive Type</h3>
            <p>The other type of ADHD results in hyperactivity in individuals. In classroom settings this may mean students cannot sit still, stop talking, or pay attention to other people’s feelings and viewpoints. People with this type of ADHD are more likely to get into dangerous situations without realizing it due to their restless nature. Although this is the less common of the two conditions, it still affects about 70% of the ADHD adult population. </p>
            <p><strong>However</strong>, don’t forget that students with ADHD have their strengths too. Students can hyperfocus on something they enjoy which results in incredible determination to complete a task well. Along with hyperfocus, ADHD individuals display acts of resilience because they often run into setbacks that must be overcome. Although maybe their most unique trait is being creative. Since ADHD people’s minds function differently from neurotypicals and they can imagine things beyond what a typical mind can. As a teacher, be sure to embrace the beauties of being different and never ostracize a student.</p>
