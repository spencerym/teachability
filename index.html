            <h2>About Neurodiversity</h2>
            <p>Neurodiversity is a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with dyspraxia, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism, Tourette syndrome, and others.</p>

            <p>Universal Design
                Creating with universal design means it is made accessible to everyone regardless of age, ability, or race. In order for teachers to create a curriculum that is universal it is important to consider even the few outliers. To do so, it is advisable to ask the students at the beginning of the year what their preferences about learning are. In this way, a teacher can adapt their lesson plans to their students. So likely examples are including power points for each lecture, video demonstrations, hands-on activities, etc. When in doubt, hear the kids out!</p>
