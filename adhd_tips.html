            <h2>Tips for Teachers</h2>

            <h3>1. Tips and Tricks</h3>
            <p>These strategies are not necessarily required for a certain diagnosis but can help make learning easier for children with ADHD.</p>

            <h4>Math</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Give students more time for exams so they don't feel pressured. Try to steer clear of timed facts tests.</li>
                <li>Regularly verify students' work for accuracy. Set a limit on the number of problems they must complete before allowing them to proceed (e.g., one row or four or five problems), and ensure they are verified.</li>
                <li>Provide a list of steps or approaches to techniques and multi-step tasks. Provide students with a desk copy model of the processes required to solve problems or post steps with clear numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the use of speech-to-text programs, such as Dragon Dictation or the free feature found in Google Docs.</li>
                <li>Permit students to replace written papers or essays with alternative projects, such as original films, dioramas, posters, or PowerPoint presentations.</li>
                <li>Allow typing in place of handwriting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reading</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tests can be read aloud to students.</li>
                <li>Consider using audiobooks with human narration, e-texts with text-to-speech software, or combo programs like LearningAlly audiobooks or Kindle Immersion reading to improve comprehension.</li>
                <li>Allow students with impaired working memory and critical thinking skills to annotate print books using highlighters and sticky notes to help them comprehend and retain information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Executive Function</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Give students a second set of books to read at home.</li>
                <li>Encourage them to complete seventy-five percent of the given homework.</li>
                <li>During class, frequently ask the student how they plan to recall the rules or facts that were covered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Emotion and Behavior</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Offer a space for the student to take breaks and relax when needed. Make a plan in advance so the student can indicate to the teacher when it's time for a break and leave without drawing attention to themselves or causing a disturbance.</li>
                <li>Arrange a weekly check-in with the special education instructor or guidance counselor.</li>
                <li>If upset tantrums are a regular issue, have a behavior intervention plan (BIP) or crisis plan in place.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Instruction</h3>
            <p>The techniques you apply when teaching:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide simple, straightforward instructions. Use charts, props, and other visual tools.</li>
                <li>Change up the tempo and incorporate a variety of activities. Energetic, high-intensity activities, such as competitive games, are beneficial for many ADHD students.</li>
                <li>Establish an anonymous cue system with the student, like a little tap on the shoulder or a post-it note on their desk, as a gentle reminder to stay focused.</li>
                <li>Offer regular breaks and provide a physical release, such as tapping something silent or squeezing a rubber ball.</li>
                <li>Avoid asking a student with ADHD to carry out an assignment or provide a public response to a question that might be too challenging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Intervention</h3>
            <p>The process of stopping actions that cause other students to get distracted or lose focus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work out some indicators with the student to prevent time-consuming behavior that distracts others. This could be indicated with a sticky note on the student's desk, a discreet shoulder squeeze, or a hand signal.</li>
                <li>If you must talk about the student's behavior, have a private conversation. Additionally, if somewhat incorrect behavior is accidental and doesn't distract others or interfere with the lesson, attempt to overlook it.</li>
            </ul>
